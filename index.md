## Featured Project

### Public Transport Patronage Recovery in Post-COVID Victoria
**Tools:** Tableau, SQL, Excel  
- Assessed whether patronage returned to pre-COVID “normal” or stabilised at a new baseline  
- Found recovery is strongest on weekends and weakest on weekdays, suggesting reduced routine commuting  
- Highlighted implications for demand-aligned, mode-specific service planning
